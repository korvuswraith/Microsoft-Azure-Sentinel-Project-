# Microsoft-Azure-Sentinel-Project- 

#In this project of mine, I use third-party API to plot an attacker's near accurate location on a map based on attacker's IP from real-time failed RDP attacks against my honeypot that I've set up on Microsoft Azure. I've set up Sentinel, which is Microsoft's Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) program to take in all the logs, while a custom PowerShell script automates plotting the attackers' estimated geolocation on a map as well as magnitude of attack.
